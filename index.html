				<p>Scientists have defined Climate to be a description of an average weather over a period ranging from months to millions of years. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) is classically averaging this period to be 30 years whereas the description often includes temperature, predication and wind. The changes observed in climate can be attributed to the system’s internal dynamics, external forcings such as the solar radiation and the anthropogenic forcings such as the greenhouse gases emitted by humans</p>
				<p>Among all forcing agents affecting the climate; the anthropogenic part was the most destructive to the climate equilibrium. Solar radiation that manages to penetrate the atmosphere and wasn’t reflected by it or by the earth surface; gets absorbed by aerosols suspended in the atmosphere. Those aerosols particle in turn emits back the absorbed radiation into the earth surface and the lower layer of the atmosphere warming them. This effect is called the greenhouse gas effect</p>
				<p>The main culprit of among those aerosol particles was found to be carbon dioxide. Since the first industrial revolution; mankind started emitting harmful greenhouse gases into the atmosphere thus increasing their concentrations and ultimately, aggravating the greenhouse effect</p>
				<p>Ever since the global warming was proven to be a fact; efforts of mitigation and adaptation has been internationally to avert potential catastrophic climate system failure. Extreme climate events were observed to be more frequent and more destructive. Humankind ability to withstand such events has be tested many times over the recent years and the results were not encouraging. Government precautions and prevention measures failed to safeguard against such devastation</p>

			<div class="Subtitle-2"><h2>Timeline of Climate Accords</h2>
			</div>
				<div class="Content-Subtitle-2">
				<p>In 1992, governments gathered at Rio de Janeiro to coordinate their actions in the themes of environment and sustainable development. One of the three conventions adopted in that conference was the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change (UNFCCC). In 1997, the UNFCCC signatories sought to introduce a legally binding targets of GHG reductions thus introduced Kyoto Protocol which required developed countries to limit their GHG emissions below their base year levels. Following the first commitment period of Kyoto Protocol which expired in 2012; a second commitment period which was marked as the Doha Amendment to Kyoto Protocol required 144 of the signatory parties to ratify in order to become effective. The required number of ratifying parties was never reached therefore the amendment has not come into effect yet</p>
				<p>In 2015, the world witnessed the first legally binding agreement aimed to create an action plan against climate change. The agreement went into effect on the 4th of November 2016 after being ratified by at least 55 parties of the Convention accounting for at least 55% of global GHG emissions</p>
				<p>Paris Agreement requires all parties to submit the Nationally Determined Contribution – NDCs and report regularly their GHG emissions. The agreement in its article 2 aims to: (1) hold the temperature increase to well below 2C above pre-industrial level. (2) adapt to climate change impacts, and (3) ease finance that helps to lower GHG emissions and increases climate resilience</p>

			</div>
				<div class="Content-Subtitle-3">
				<p>The UAE has been always active in the field environment preservation and sustainable development. The late ruler of UAE H.H Sheik Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan was not only a political leader but also and an environment protection leader. In 1995, Sheik Zayed was awarded a gold medal from the Food and Agriculture Organization for his efforts in agriculture domestically and internationally</p>
				<p>Sheik Zayed was also awarded the Golden Panda by the World Wildlife Fund in the year 1997 for his efforts in protecting the wildlife</p>
				<p>In December 1995, the UAE acceded to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and in March 1996 the UAE became an official member of the Convention</p>
